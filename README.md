# ServerCraft?
A little app for managing Minecraft servers because I'm a huge nerd I guess?

I created this to learn React, Flux, and Webpack. Woop woop.

ServerCraft is a little web app written in Node, React, and Reflux for managing Minecraft servers.
After logging in with your Mojang account, you'll be able to create and launch new worlds, see who's
online, ban / kick folks, and whatever else.
